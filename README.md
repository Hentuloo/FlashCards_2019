> React application to learn english. There's a authorization page using JWT. You can create new types/section of words and then adds own words to learn. There's a possibility to draw random card(word and description) and table to study each card.

Configuration:

- eslint + airbnb
- prettier
- husky + lint-staged

Data:

- Redux + Redux thunk
- axios
- validator

## To do:

- index for types (I want to add the ability to change the display order of types)
- change card content (Now you can only remove card and add new with correct content)
- create translator
- To any card add acquisition rate (I want to exhibit cards that have not been taught)
- +Impossible bonus: create functionaly to buy premium, then the user can have more types/sections of words
